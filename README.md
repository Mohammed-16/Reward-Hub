Mechanism to Incentivize and Provide Recognition to Open-Source Contributors

## How RewardHub leverages IPFS and Filecoin Virtual Machine

- We are using IPFS as its storage solution for secure and decentralized data storage.
- All assests, metadata, and NFTs are stored on this decentralized network, ensuring that data is secure, reliable and redundant.
- The platform's smart contracts are deployed on multiple chains, including Filecoin Testnet Hyperspace, Polygon, and Mantle.
- This approach makes RewardHub a multichain platform, which enables more users to onboard and provides greater flexibility and choice to customers, allowing them to onboard easily from different chains.

## How to Run the project

- Step 1: Clone the repo and install the dependencies
- Step 2: Deploy the contracts on the wallaby network using Remix IDE for ease of use
- Step 3: Run `yarn install && yarn dev` to start the app
